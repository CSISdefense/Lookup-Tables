## Country Codes
Country codes are complicated because they are inherently political and also because they change over time.

For internal purposes translate these codes into ISO Alpha 3 codes. Those codes are not the most space efficient, ISO Alpha 2 works better for that purpose, but they are easier for people to read in their abbreviated form. We store these in the table Location.CountryCode.





Geographical classifications are available through the [U.N.Standard country or area codes for statistical use (M49)](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/overview/)
